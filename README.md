## Description

This Project is part of Data Science Nanodegree Program by Udacity in collaboration with Figure Eight.
The initial dataset contains pre-labelled tweet and messages from real-life disaster. 
The aim of the project is to build a Natural Language Processing tool that categorize messages.

The Project is divided in the following Sections:

1. Data Processing, ETL Pipeline to extract data from source, clean data and save them in a proper databse structure.
2. Machine Learning Pipeline to train a model able to classify text message in categories.
3. Web App to show model results in real time.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
* Python 3.5+
* Machine Learning Libraries: NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Sciki-Learn
* Natural Language Process Libraries: NLTK
* SQLlite Database Libraqries: SQLalchemy
* Web App and Data Visualization: Flask, Plotly

### Additional Material

In the **data** and **models** folder you can find two jupyter notebook that will help you understand how the model works step by step:
1. **ETL Preparation Notebook**: learn everything about the implemented ETL pipeline
2. **ML Pipeline Preparation Notebook**: look at the Machine Learning Pipeline developed with NLTK and Scikit-Learn

You can use **ML Pipeline Preparation Notebook** to re-train the model or tune it through a dedicated Grid Search section.
In this case, it is warmly recommended to use a Linux machine to run Grid Search, especially if you are going to try a large combination of parameters.
Using a standard desktop/laptop (4 CPUs, RAM 8Gb or above) it may take several hours to complete.
